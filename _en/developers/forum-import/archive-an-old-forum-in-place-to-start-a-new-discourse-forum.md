When possible, **we recommend archiving old forums rather than importing them into Discourse**. Sometimes this isn't possible, for various reasons, but getting a fresh start and moving into a new community platform without carrying all your old baggage across is often appealing.

Maybe your community needs a reboot.

But how do you 

- Keep the valuable information at old forums around without keeping that ancient forum *software* running, too, with all its future security vulnerabilities? 
- Avoid losing any Google juice for old existing links to good, useful community posts on your domain?
