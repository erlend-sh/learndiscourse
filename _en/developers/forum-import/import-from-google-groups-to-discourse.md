Continuing the discussion from [Discourse in the news...](http://meta.discourse.org/t/discourse-in-the-news/4911):

In a section about Google Groups...

>Google Groups has the stink of neglect about it. Serious online groups tend to move off the platform and into custom-coded websites, vertical community platforms like StackOverflow, or adaptable open source solutions like Discourse and phpBB.

That mention is a link! :smile:

I'm in the process of migrating my OSS project's Google Groups (which is used mostly by me and a few followers) to Discourse. As there is not a lot of history yet and Google will keep it for some years I think (and I have backup in my mail account), I planned to just install the Discourse forums and start from scratch.

However, it would be a bit nicer if I could import the Google Groups discussions into Discourse.
Does such importer already exists?
