You may have noticed that, by default, all Discourse users start out as trust level zero.

What is the purpose of these trust levels, and why do they exist? How do you get to higher trust levels, and what do they do?

(This is a FAQ topic intended only for documenting what the levels are, if you wish to discuss what the trust levels should be or could be, please visit this topic or another similar one.)
