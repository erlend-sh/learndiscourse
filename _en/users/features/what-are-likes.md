## Properties of Likes

- All likes are public:
 - Each post shows which users have liked it
 - A user's profile tracks all given and received likes.
- The first "Like" on a post will trigger a notification to the post's author.
- Likes can also award [badges](#).
   - Example: a post with 10 likes will grant the author a "Nice Post" badge (default admin setting).
- You can not like your own post.
- You can only like a post once.
- You can only undo a like within 10 minutes after submitting the like. (default admin setting).
- Likes affect post rankings (undocumented) (Top, external comments etc.)
- The amount of likes you can pass out in a day depends on your [Trust Level]().
