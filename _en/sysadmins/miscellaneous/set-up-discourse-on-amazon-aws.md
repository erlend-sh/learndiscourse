Hello everyone!

I have taken the time to write up a blog post on how to setup Discourse on Amazon AWS. You can view the blog post here. http://blog.nahtnam.com/how-to-setup-discourse-on-amazon-aws/

Please feel free to leave a comment on the blog post, or here and I will try to reply as soon as possible! :smile: 

@sam and @codinghorror Is there anything I can improve with the tutorial?
